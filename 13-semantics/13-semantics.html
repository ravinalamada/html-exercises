          3. This excerpt is from a short story called "The story of your life" by "Ted Chiang". Supply the attribution to the author and their title, then mark-up the following excerpt correctly:

          "The only reason you had me was so you could get a maid you wouldn't have to pay," you'll say bitterly, dragging the vacuum cleaner out of the closet.

          "That's right!" I'll say. "Thirteen years ago I knew the carpets would need vacuuming around now, and having a baby seemed to be the cheapest and easiest way to get the job done. Now kindly get on with it."

          "If you weren't my mother, this would be illegal," you'll say, seething as you unwind the power cord and plug it into the wall outlet.

              - The page title
              - A link to the page
              - A summary of where the entered search term matches the page
